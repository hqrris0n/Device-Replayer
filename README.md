## Usage
The **Mouse Controls** and **Keyboard Controls** have identical controls. The first section is to name and record an action. After pressing record, do your actions, then press `esc`. The second section allows you to select the recording and replay it a given number of time with a default value of 1. You can also add it to a queue for a mixed series of actions. The number of repeats in the field will also be added to the queue

In the **Paste Text** section, you can paste a text to automatically type out one character at a time at a selected speed. Default speed is 9, the fastest. You can also add these to the queue.

In the **Queue** section, you can play the items in the queue from top to bottom. The list shows the name and the number of times it will repeat. You can add a delay to the beginning of the queue.

In the **Setting** section, you can change the stop button from `esc` to another key. You can also set a delay for the start of each action. If you want to delay each item in a loop to be delayed. Both rules apply to the queue as well.

**There is currently no button to stop after replay has started. Either forcibly shut down the program or wait for it to end.**
