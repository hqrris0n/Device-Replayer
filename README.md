Device Replayer

- Records and stores sequences of keyboard or mouse actions.
- Records keyboard and mouse sequences seperately, but there is 
  a queue function to combine sequences together.
- Once playback starts, there is currently no built-in feature 
  to force the program to stop running! Close the program from the 
  taskbar.
- The code can be deleted upon download, but the "save files"
  folder must be in the same folder as the .exe

Thanks for checking it out!
